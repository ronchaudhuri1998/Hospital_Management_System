# Hospital_Management_System
• Designed and implemented a comprehensive database system for managing critical hospital operations, including patient records, doctor assignments, appointment scheduling, and billing processes.

• Developed a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using ER-Assistant to visualize the database schema, showcasing six main entities (Patient, Doctor, Department, Appointment, Bill, and their relationships).

• Utilized postgreSQL for database modeling and implementation, ensuring efficient data storage by normalizing the schema to Third Normal Form (3NF) to minimize redundancy and optimize performance.

• Implemented advanced SQL features such as triggers, views, and stored procedures to automate processes like billing generation and ensure secure data management.
